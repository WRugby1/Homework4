## Coding quiz

For this assignment, I created a quiz structure that houses 10 questions and answers inside an object array. 
The quiz works almost entirely off javascript, and runs with a timer in the background. 
The user asked for this acceptance criteria, which is all met in the app:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
